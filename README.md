# PD2map_CapitolSavingsBank

Crew,

We have a new job this time. Preferred to go stealth, but we will 
be prepared for sure.

_Briefing_

Our informer telling us about some other branch we can hit. Opened 
just like a month ago. We have basically branch like Harvest&Trustee, 
but bigger and served by other company. Seems to be medium government 
affilate bank. Be calm, that's not Federal Cash Reserve Bank, so that
is not gonna be _really_ hard.

_The plan_

So, we going just as usual: look around, find the vault, take the money. 
That's your well known job. But this one looks more interesting. Hear 
our trusted men, that's gonna be something special. Our driver will wait 
outside while you working. Careful, bigger branch - more civilians. Also 
expecting more guards there. Think twice before do something serious.
