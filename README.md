"U.S. Capitol Savings Bank"

Today guys, we gonna hit something new for us. United States Capitol Savings Bank, another medium-class bank around Washington D.C. By looking on this I even caught myself on funny thing: It is probably former H&T building, so... we just got bankrupt those branch in this district? Huh. It's some other bank, slightly changed style, but looks familiar... 

Alright guys, time to get our job done! Get inside, take a look at their stuff and find a way into the vault. And yes, good luck.
