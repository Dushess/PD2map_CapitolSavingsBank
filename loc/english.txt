"heist_Capitol Savings Bank_brief" : "This is another branchbank in Washington. You know the drill - go inside, put your mask on and empty the vault. This one looks a bit familiar, not H&T, but as I seen they're more advanced, so be careful. You just cannot open the vault suddenly. They have time-lock, it means outside control... Yeah. But I'm sure, we can deal with this. Now, go get that money!"

"heist_csb_brief" : "This is another bank branch in Washington DS. You know the drill: go inside, put your mask on and empty the vault. This is like bigger Harvest&Trustee, but as I seen they're more advanced, so be careful. You just cannot open the vault suddenly. They have time-lock, it means outside control... You need to be careful. Now, go get that money!"
"heist_csb_briefing_name" : "U.S. Capitol Savings Bank"
"heist_csb_briefing_brief" : "Today guys, we gonna hit something new for us. United States Capitol Savings Bank, another medium-class bank around Washington D.C. Probably government affilated branch, look at the style... Pretty similar to our recent jobs, but it's some other. Different look and details, but still familiar... \n Alright guys, time to get our job done! Get inside, take a look at their stuff and find a way into the vault. \n And yes, good luck."
"bain_start_01" : "Ready? Let's go inside, look around, find a way into the vault, then secure the money. Simple, but not so easy job." --unused?
"bain_start_02" : "Ok crew, are you ready? Then let's go inside, check everything - loot everything, make me happy. I will watch here." --unused?
"bain_start_03" : "Ok guys, today we will be rich,.. yeah, like real. Check the guards and cameras, find a way to open the vault and put that money in right place." --unused?
"bain_ins_st1_pre_01" : "So, our insider telling about vault opening schedule, phone numbers, etc. But we are late, next one is soon but not this day. They have TSU, to store goods in and out and not touch vault door every time. Make a vault team assasination is also not an option, some customers from hall or staff from office might see it, or else get concerned why the hell they're out so long. You know what, we will make an unscheduled donation to them. Fake of course, so we're here exactly today. He also marked keybox for the vault and left keycard in security room, nice guy."
"bain_ins_st1_pre_02" : "Today we have the right man in needed place. The insider brought to us schedule of vault handling and other useful info. Also he left a keycard in security room, and you will like that, marked keybox place. Good job. To say shortly, they have Temp Storage Unit there, should be almost full already, and by that we arrived exactly today, they should believe in our legend. We gonna impersonate a company agents which wants to place a deposit fast, and after we'll call GenSec to inform. Funny if they anyway not gonna realize that there is no deposit and company until..."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_01" : "You need to find finance manager's office, it's to the right from main hall, reception also can show it, you are 'company agents' today. Tie him down if we will met him there, he also has little door opening present. After that we will make a phone call. Careful, there is might be a camera, and another customers. Do it right."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_02" : "Go behind the main hall, step into manager's office on right side and patch me to his phone. We will trick GenSec today. Just look on news paper tomorrow: 'Heisters gang literally said about bank robbery and did it quietly'. But first stop is reception desk. Oh yes, there's might be some other guys later to make a deal. Take care of manager to not be on everyones view in office."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_03" : "Enter their manager's office, connect me to his phone and I'll solve this. If he's there, tie him down and borrow his keycard, huh. First make that in civil, you're a 'company agents', yeah? Reception desk staff will recieve your offer and send you to finance manager's office to make a deal. Check the grimm and let's go."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_04" : "Now don't waste much time, talk to reception - 'we are a company, we want to push a money into your branch today...' and another crap about deposits. Then go to manager and tie him down if he's there. After that you taking his keycard and patching me to his phone. Close blinders to be sure. Ooh and don't forget to put him somewhere, if another customers will have some deals too."
"bain_ins_st1_reception_remind_01" : "C'mon c'mon, time doesn't stand still, we need to go. Money calls."
"bain_ins_st1_reception_remind_02" : "O-oh, it's right there, even sign says 'Reception & Waiting'. You need only first part of it."
"bain_ins_st1_reception_remind_03" : "What's wrong? Everyone got the legs stuck in the sidewalk? Don't chill around too long, we are on the job actually."
"bain_ins_st1_reception_remind_04" : "Are you still here? We paid the insider now for nothing. He done good job there, all this time he worked well. Follow his lead, ok? Make me proud."
"player_ins_st1_reception_dia_01-1" : "Hello, we would like to make a corporative deposit in your branch. Can you help us with that?"
"player_ins_st1_reception_dia_01-2" : "Good day, we are corporative agents and want to inject a deposit today. Can we speak to manager?"
"recsta_ins_st1_reception_dia_01-1" : "Hello, please provide some data - who are you, which company you representing and little details of deal."

We've arrived to make a cash donation for long period, a deposit, about a year and half. Also heard you're good branch for big enough deals, right?"
"player_ins_st1_reception_dia_02-2" : "Yeah, sure. My name is S.Jackson, and that's my colleagues and companions for deal - mr. F.Kenwood, R.Andersson and H.Belowski. Little more, that's a cash donation for our business. Representing -companyname-. Our boss wants to store money with good options. And we sure we making right choice." ,

Today we're here because our chief looks for a good establishment for long-time cash holding. We also got a recommendation about your branch. What you can offer?"
"recsta_ins_st1_reception_dia_02" : "A minute please... I'll check some things..."
"recsta_ins_st1_reception_dia_03-1" : "Yes. Sir, the manager waits you in public office there. Please proceed forward into main hall, at the end turn right and shortly to the left, there is sign 'Manager' above. Check if he's there right now. Or wait inside for him."
"recsta_ins_st1_reception_dia_03-2" : "Of course, sir. I will call the manager to his office, please wait there. He may be busy right now. Look trough customer hall on 'Deals' sign, the way is straight between visible Units, right turn near windowed wall and then to the left."
"recsta_ins_st1_reception_dia_03-3" : "Good. The manager should be in public office behind the customer hall, 'Deals' sign above. You need to go into main hall, passing tellers unit and personal credit unit, at the end turn right and shortly after to the left."
"player_ins_st1_reception_dia_03-1" : "Thank you."
"player_ins_st1_reception_dia_03-2" : "Thanks, ma'am."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_remind_01" : "When I said there is might be camera, I didn't said there is might be entire FBI office. Meet the manager and do the job for me."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_remind_02" : "C'mon, she told you the way. Forward trough the entire hall, turn right, then left. Step up!"
"bain_ins_st1_manager_remind_03" : "So, you want to just stand here or you will go to manager's office? I'm still waiting."
"bain_ins_st1_manager_remind_04" : "Guys, the manager's office, go get into it."
"bain_ins_st2_reshedule_pre_01" : "Now, I'll do the magic..."
"bain_ins_st2_reshedule_pre_02" : "And then, pick up the phone, miss..."
"bain_ins_st2_reshedule_pre_03" : "You will not even see this masks inside the vault..."
"bain_ins_st3_injection_01" : "It worked, now just open the vault 'on schedule', but keycards must be stolen anyway. Or you have them already? Also you need door codes, they are in a folder somewhere in manager's office, maybe supervisor have it."
"bain_ins_st3_injection_02" : "She is sure, we really will put money into THIS vault. Find two keycards and start the time lock. Don't be late. And get also vault door codes in head offices. Should be safe or some spot, where it stored. You may start right here."
"bain_ins_st3_injection_03" : "If bank personnel even knew about this deposit injection... Use keycards on timelock and wait. Don't have it yet? Hurry up and get them! Don't forget about papers with door codes, it should be in office of director, or right here in manager's room."
"operator_ins_st2_gensec_call_01-1" : "Operator: GenSec Control, this is Margaret, what you need?"
"operator_ins_st2_gensec_call_01-2" : "Hello, GenSec Control, Margaret speaking."
"operator_ins_st2_gensec_call_01-3" : "GenSec Control, this is Janett, what happened?"
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_01a" : "Hello, this is Mike, Capitol Savings Bank at Brentwood, Montana Ave NE, 1739."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_01-1" : "We have a big customer here. He wanna push a deposit in our branch right today. Got a recommendation... and don't want to wait for scheduled time. Also TSU is almost full today, not gonna fit. We requesting shift on this day, also will move values to inject from TSU to full-time storage."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_01-2" : "We have a company agent here. He want to place a deposit in our branch today. Got a recommendation about us... a-and don't want to wait a schedule. Additionally we don't have enough space in our TSU for now, better move everything today. So, we informing you about this, do you ageed?"
"operator_ins_st2_gensec_call_02-1" : "O-k, I need some data from him: company name, agent name, cash donation amount, also plan and deposit time."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_02-1" : "Sure, -companyname-, mr. A.Dannet, injecting $284000. Standard+ on 2 years."

"operator_ins_st2_gensec_call_03-3" : "So... you can open the vault for his money and rest at 9:50AM, have a nice day."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_03-1" : "Understood, bye."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_03-2" : "Yes, thanks."
"bain_ins_st2_fman_gensec_call_03-3" : "Ok, bye."
"bain_sta_st1_pre_01" : "So, our informer said he seen there a timelock, seems to be synchronized action for door unlocking, but maybe they have something special. Keep in mind guards and civs, security is decent. Check the server room and connect me to their system, I gonna take a look... And yes, to be extra safe don't touch keycard panels for now."
"bain_sta_st1_pre_02" : "The guy who brought this job for us, said he seen there a timelock and pretty much civilians and guards. So be careful, find keycards to open the vault. But first let me look into this, server room is a key for many things. Including security. Patch me in and I'll check the things. Just save 2 cards until it really will be safe to use."
"bain_sta_st1_pre_03" : "By our trusted man's data there is good enough security, vault behind the main hall and a timelock system. Looks as usual, but I want to look more precisely. Go to server room, patch me there and I'll say what is what. Yes, the keycards, seems to be manager has one. Check also some spots around. Maybe there is safe with more useful things somewhere."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_01" : "Yes, no reasons to rush, but our job is waiting. Patch me to server guys."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_02" : "If you ready, go to server room and do the job, so I can do the job."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_03" : "Uhh? Stop wasting time, are you not want to take this money? We've rolled out, so let's do this."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_04" : "What happened? Can't find the server room? Signs everywhere in this branch, just look at them."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_05" : "We can't just open the door without disabling the time lock, suspicious, head to server room if not busy with something else."
"bain_sta_st1_reminder1_06" : "Guys, the server room, go get into it."
"bain_sta_st1_1hack_01" : "Ok guys, wait a second..."
"bain_sta_st1_1hack_02" : "Connecting now,.. that is..."
"bain_sta_st2_1hack_fail_01" : "Something is wrong, no access. Of course... guys, you need to patch me to one of their terminals instead, or better manager's computer."
"bain_sta_st2_1hack_fail_02" : "A firewall, what I've expected? Huh, find a local computer and let me into their net this way. High staff PC will be fine,.. uhm... go to manager."
"bain_sta_st2_1hack_fail_03" : "Nice thing, it blocked me. Internet is scary thing, yeh. Use internal access, through staff computers. I'll bypass this one. Try to use manager's PC."
"bain_sta_st2_solution_x1remind_01" : "It surely will be staff terminals, or better lead's PC. Find a manager's one. He is chief for cash operations here and should have access to vault control system."
"bain_sta_st2_solution_x1remind_02" : "You need to find one of terminals with opened session to vault control system, I'm sure best way is their finance manager's computer. Careful, camera might be there."
"bain_sta_st2_reminder2_01" : "Don't forget about manager's PC, I need access."
"bain_sta_st2_reminder2_02" : "What again? I'm waiting..."
"bain_sta_st2_reminder2_03" : "*whispering* You're too busy there, yes? How about to add some hackery into your tasklist? On PC of finance manager."
"bain_sta_st2_reminder2_04u" : "Is there a... Oh, no, seems fine, just do your job."
"bain_sta_st2_reminder2_05" : "Too many guards around? Or some workers staying right on needed path? Ok, take it right, but don't forget about the task."
"bain_sta_st2_back_to_server_01" : "Little package installed, now i can use WAN to take a step into their system."
"bain_sta_st2_back_to_server_02" : "Small present is here, now get back to server room and patch me again."
"bain_sta_st2_2hack_01" : "I'm connecting again,.. this time is better... Done, now hacking into VCS, wait somewhere until I finish this."
"bain_sta_st2_2hack_02" : "Yes, you will pass me now... I'm here, guys, started hacking in their system, will take few minutes."
"bain_sta_st3_2hack_fin_01" : "It's done now. Hmm, time lock, opening detector and no automated gear. Really it needs to be opened manually with codes, but there is no codes in their system. Find them, must be somewhere in head offices, manager's, maybe director's... Use keycards and then turn everything upside down, we need their secrets."
"bain_sta_st3_2hack_fin_02" : "Hack is complete. There is time lock protection and opening detector, but nothing about automatic handling. I've set fake time lock test procedure. Nice trick, expecting nice and smooth override,.. or not so,.. just be ready for security call in there. Next use keycards and then you need codes for those three handles to open the door. Find it, somewhere in there."
"bain_sta_st3_2hack_fin_03" : "I'm done, now you need to place keycards and wait for it. They don't use automatic opening after time lock. Not found any clues of door codes in their database, it should physically exist in a USB stick or a folder or something there, go find it. Check everywhere it can be stored, probably same manager's room. I don't know."
"bain_sta_st3_reminder3_01" : "Not find the codes yet? Look in desks, shelves, everywhere; maybe a safe contains it."
"bain_sta_st3_reminder3_02" : "You cannot open the vault door silently without codes, if you have so much time, you can even lockpick it,.. But actually nope. I'm sure only codes will help to do it nice and easy. Find them!"
"bain_sta_st3_reminder3_03" : "Have you found secret papers already? Check the all places. May be in just well obvious place."
"bain_sta_st3_reminder3_04u" : "*yawn* You looking for it? Good. Wake me up when it will be yours..."
"bain_sta_st3_papers_01" : "Oh, that's the folder with codes, now go to vault and open it."
"bain_sta_st3_papers_02" : "You're found it, that papers is not confidential anymore, use the codes on vault door."
"bain_sta_st3_papers_03" : "Yes! Now we ready to enter the vault, go and open it with those codes."
"bain_sta_st3_we_ready_x1remind_01" : "Vault door is ready now, no time to waste, open it and go inside."
"bain_sta_st3_door_ready_01ul" : "Unlocked? Now roll that handle and go in."
"bain_sta_vault_boxes_01" : "Check also the deposit boxes."
"bain_sta_vault_boxes_02" : "Don't forget about deposit boxes folks."
"bain_sta_escape_ready_01" : "Now we can leave, or you can stay for more."
"bain_sta_escape_ready_02" : "Money, sweet money, loaded and ready to go home. You can also escape, or if feeling lucky, take more loot."
"bain_sta_escape_ready_03" : "Good work guys, now we can leave. You might stay for more but be careful."
"bain_sta_escape_ready_04" : "Now we can leave, or try to take all if you can."
"bain_bfsr_go_loud_01" : "Are you professionals? Alarms is not in our plans. Ugh, okay, take the thermal drill and place on the vault door. Then connect me to their system in server room. Don't forget to activate time lock, find two keycards for it. Also defend the server room while I working. I need to check, what they have for vault control and other things..."
"bain_bfsr_go_loud_02" : "Loud way is best way, to be crushed. I hope you can withstand that. Now, put that thermal drill on vault door, then two keycards into time lock panels! And patch me to their servers, might be some surprises there, i need to check. Don't forget about electric switches, maybe vault and server is always powered, but PC's are not so safe."
"bain_bfsr_go_loud_03" : "What have you done? We don't even know yet what exactly we facing in this branch, but cops already on the way. Ohh, you must connect me to they servers in IT room, then activate those timelock with two keycards. Don't forget about thermal drill, Twitch already bailing, but has dropped it to you. Hurry up!"
"bain_afsr_go_loud_01" : "That's the alarm guys, patch me to this thing and grab the thermal drill for the door, Twitch leave it before bailing as usual, keycards also must be placed in panels. I will work here, cover the server room."
"bain_afsr_go_loud_02" : "Not again, connect me to server on admin's PC and I will check what is what here. Your task now is pick up the thermal drill, install it to the vault door and get keycards for time lock system. Use them if already have."
"bain_a1sh_go_loud_01" : "Damn, what's happened, did you leave a hostage for everyone to see? Go to your van, and get the thermal drill for the door, Twitch dropped it now. Then activate timelock and start drilling. And don't forget about manager's PC."
"bain_a1sh_go_loud_02" : "Are that sirens in the distance? Pick up the thermal drill which is in the van, put it on the vault door and use keycards on timelock panels. Maybe you're already have them. Someone check manager's PC, I need access."
"bain_arth_go_loud_01" : "Alarm tripped? Hurry up back to server room, we need to continue fast! Then place thermal drill on vault's door and use keycards."
"bain_arth_go_loud_02" : "What's that? Your fault? Ok, go back to server room and patch me trough, we continuing anyway. Then place thermal drill on vault's door and use keycards."
"bain_avch_go_loud_01" : "Damn, that's the alarm. Twitch will leave now as usual, but he have a thermal drill for you."
"bain_avch_go_loud_01b" : "I seen something suspicious, and yes, code drums are locked now..."
"bain_avch_go_loud_01c" : "Shit, there is also locking pins sealing armed,.. oh look, i can hack it, and... Ugh, but you need to connect me again, it kicked me and dropped my token."
"bain_avch_go_loud_01d" : "Unfortunately drums sealing hack will take much more time, better drill it up."
"bain_avch_go_loud_02" : "Alarm sounds? What have you done so stupid? Right, go loud then, Twitch dropped your thermal drill, install it on the door."
"bain_avch_go_loud_02b" : "Since they have locking system active, you need to be ugly with this, just drill it through."
"bain_avch_go_loud_02c" : "Oh shit, also pins magnetic sealing in action,.. and I'm disconnected. Tough thing, drilling each of them is really nightmare, but please just connect me back."
"bain_avch_go_loud_02d" : "Don't worry, I can hack sealing and unlock door pins to you."
"bain_vchf_door_seal_done_01" : "Yes, that's free now, waiting for finish the thermal drill. Otherwise door is ready, open up."
"bain_vchf_door_seal_done_02" : "That thing is beaten, locking pins are free. If drill is done, you can open the door."
"bain_vchf_door_seal_done_03" : "Finished, if our drill is also done, roll the handle and open this black door."
"operator_event_gs_check_call_01-1" : "Hello, this is Janett from GenSec, we detected an unscheduled vault time lock activation. Is everything fine there?"
"operator_event_gs_check_call_01-2" : "Good day, Janett speaking, from GenSec. We have unscheduled time lock activation in your branch. What happened there?"
"bain_A_fman_answer_gs_check_call_01" : "Hello, Mike speaking,.. uugh, there is some malfunction at time-lock system... Our worker stumbled near the vault door, dropped a crate on keycard panel and broke it. It triggered activation sequence somehow, we already working on it, all fine now."
"bain_B_fssc_answer_gs_check_call_01" : "Yes, that's Johnatan, security service, we have vault control system problem here. A timelock test, as I heard from IT guy, but somehow it was sent to you as normal launch. He said it will be fixed soon. Sorry for bothering you, and it's still operational."
"operator_event_A_check_call_02-1_G" : "Uhuh, yes... But just tell him he will be fired instantly for such inaccuracy next time."
"operator_event_A_check_call_02-2_B" : "Oooh... Right, but I'll send you someone, just to be sure..."
"operator_event_A_check_call_02-3_B" : "Fine, that clumsy chop,.. i will send our guys to check, be ready."
"operator_event_B_check_call_02-1_G" : "Uhuh,.. I got it, just be more provident with this."
"operator_event_B_check_call_02-2_G" : "Ok, tell him that his possible fault can leave a bad mark on your reputation."
"operator_event_B_check_call_02-3_B_no_trick" : "Hmm, that's an interesting thing. I'll send you a team to be sure."
"bain_event_gensec_appr_solution_01" : "GenSec car is approaching, give them a warm welcome."
"bain_event_gensec_appr_solution_01b" : "Or try to sneak around, they will check the situation, if all will be clear they will leave safely. Someone of you need to be dressed up as security guy and will confirm the story, just make sure the one keycard panel is "broken" for them. And don't forget to tell about upcoming panels replacing procedure, cards already placed for it, to temporarily set and hang closed state from VCS, link still established. Others - go hide in security room, after this you _all_ will be in your suits again. And careful with local guards."
"bain_event_gensec_appr_solution_02" : "There is GenSec car moving to you, be ready."
"bain_event_gensec_appr_solution_02b" : "Also you can make them fools. Sneak somewhere and wait until it done, someone must drop mask and hide weapons in security room, wear security uniform and meet them, camera operator is already down, yes? Maybe his suit will make the trick. Just watch it from the cameras then. The chosen one of you will confirm this story, show them a "broken" keycard panel. Tell also that cards are in places to temporarily lock vault door in VCS, panels will be replaced soon. After they will leave, go back to security room and dress up again."
"bain_event_gensec_appr_solution_03b" : "Seems to be they wanna ask admin about this. But we don't have one ready to confirm our story... Right, you know what to do with them. Hope you did not killed everyone from local security, there is Control gonna be TOO concerned."
"gsg_act_event_fguard_dia_01-1" : "Hi guys, what happened here? Tell it to us, and.. callsign please."
"gsg_act_event_fguard_dia_01-2" : "Hello, what's your name and ID? I heard you have an issue here?"
"gsg_act_event_fguard_dia_01-3" : "Good day, sir. Got a problem with vault systems? Please your identity and explain more."
"player_event_fguard_answer_dia_01-1" : "Hello, my name is Steve, 3-1. Today we unloaded some crates in office supply room, our worker has drop upper pallet near the vault door, it fallen right on one of those panels and broke something inside. We currently started replacing procedure, keycards inserted, link still established. IT locking the vault door via VCS tools, until panels will be replaced. Some wiring crossing maybe, it started timelock activation and alerted you. That panel will be sent to examination and we gonna prevent it in future. All fine, don't worry."
"player_event_fguard_answer_dia_01-2" : "Hi, i'm Steve, 3-1. Yes, an accident here. Today our worker unloaded some boxes in supply room, vault door is nearby. And suddenly this clumsy guy has fallen and dropped a pallet right on one of those panels. It gets offended and somehow activated, huh. Don't look at keycards inserted, replacing procedure for panels already has begun, IT staff setting door timelocking directly from VCS, will stay like that for now, gonna restore after finishing up all of this. Strange thing, but surely for you it looked like timelock activation, yes?"
"gsg_act_A_event_fguard_dia_02-1" : "Hmm, you've good timing here,.. fine, i hope that guy already explaining this for director?"
"gsg_act_B_event_fguard_dia_02-1" : "Ok, nothing more has broke? It surely can be like that? Something unbelievable, no?"
